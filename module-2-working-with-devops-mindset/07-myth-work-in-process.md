# Addressing DevOps Myths: Work in Process

Myth: Having a lot or work-in-process is the _best_ way to get more done.

## Combine Tools for Stronger Perfomance

- Maintain WIP limits
- Combine WIP with visual displays
- Use feedback loops

## The 5 Thieves of Time

1. Too much work-in-process

    Is exarcebated by the 4 other thieves.

2. Conflicting priorities

    Too many conflicting priorities lead to work overload, which lead to taking too much work-in-process

3. Unknown dependencies

    Can lead to too much work-in-process because if we are unsure of what is dependent on something else, there's a tendency to take on too muchwork at the same time to ensure all dependencies are met simultaneously.

4. Unplanned work

    Work emergencies and unplanned work immediately create too much work-in-process.

5. Neglected work

    Neglected unfinished work contrinutes to too much work-in-process because it remains unfinished and in the back of someone's mind while taking on additional work.

## How to Apply WIP Limits

- Only work on a set number of things at once.
- Start next thing only after finishing something.
- You may have to challenge your own beliefs and instincts.

## This Will Take Time

- It will get harder before it gets better
- Past work-arounds masked problems
- Able to face the elephant in the room

## People May Resist at First

- Applying WIP limits may cause frustration
- Persist until it proves efficient
