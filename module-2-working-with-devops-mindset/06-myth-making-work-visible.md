# Addressing DevOps Myths: Making Work Visible

__Myth__: Making work visible only works in manufacturing.

- Visual displays are applicable in software
- Contribute to high-performing organizations when used with other Lean techniques

## Making Teams' Work Visible

- Visually capture all the work the team is responsible for
- Use a tool like Kanban, Trello, or Jira
- The tool itself __does not matter__, it needs to serve the teams' engagement

## Surface Work to Better Understand Flow

- Promotes problem solving
  - Over-burdenned teams
  - Not meeting commitement
- Handles competing priorities and trade-offs
- Helps to see what needs to be broken down into smaller batches
- Creates opportunity to ask questions

## The #1 Constraint: Engineering Capacity

- First step is to make work visible
- Focus on current condition and allocation
- Look at trends and pick targets
- Use data to inform decisions to improve
- Watch percentage of unplanned work

### Example of Using Data to Inform Decisions

- Teams with high ratio of features vs other work
  - More incidents
  - Issues with resilience
- Use data to help stakeholders prioritize
- The goal is to reduce the burden on teams

## Takeaway

- Get value
- Manage priorities better
- Gives a clear picture of work in a tech organization
