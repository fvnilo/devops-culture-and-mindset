## Starting Small

**The value of starting small**:

- Learn what works and what does not
- Then scale to the entire organization

**Benefits of Pilots and A/B Testing**:

- Make sure it works
- Incorporate learnign as you go

**Pilots at Nike**:

- Focusing on 6 pilot teams
- Once there is a solid approach, scale to hundreds of teams

**Start small with feature delivery**:

- Start small
- Get it into your customers' hands as fast as possible
  - Get immediate feedback
  - Learn fast
  - Adjust

**Traditional silos**:

- Dev Team
- QA Team
- Operations

Experiment of embedding QA and operations into the development team. Benefits:

- Able to be proactive
  - Dev work on something, Ops will say "this might break these"
- Fix code before testing
- Fast feedback loop

**Rolling out organizational change**:

## Evolution of Roles

**Product Owner**:

- Evolution of a business analysts role within a development teams
- The PO is a day-to-day decision maker
- They make sure that the team are working on the right things
- Working closely with the business to make sure that the right priorities are in the backlog

**Developers**:

- Change mindset to Developer/Engineer
  - No more, "I write my code and I am done".
- Accountable for:
  - Development
  - Quality
  - Security
  - Non-functional requirements
- Important to help developers see the bigger picture

Role around lines are blurring:

- Dev
- QA
- Ops

Traditional roles and lines were clear:

- Business analyst wrote requirements
- Developer wrote code
- QA tested and assured quality

When we adopt devops and lean culture, team members play multiple roles.

**Example from Nordstrom**:

- Rewriting the product web page
- Moved all needed roles into 1 team
- CI/CD pipelines built together
- Product feedback built into the process
- Quickly delivered values
- Identified and resolved issues in hours
- Driving a ton of revenue

## Takeaway

DevOps requires people to re-evaluate their roles and shift their thinking.
