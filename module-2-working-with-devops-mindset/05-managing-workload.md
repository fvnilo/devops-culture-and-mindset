# Managing Workload with a DevOps Mindset

## Tracking Work at the Team Level

- Engineering capacity is #1 constraint
- It's important to track and optimize work at team level

### Categories to Manage Work

- Feature
- Technical Debt
- Operational work
- Unplanned work

### Honoring and Extracting Reality

- Understand what is really happening
- Create an environment where teams are comfortable surfacing reality

## The Best Way To Solve a Problem

- Make it visible
- Connect data to business outcome

## Balance to Prevent Burnout

- How does the team feel?
- If teams are not getting the opportunity to focus on reducing technical debt, focusing on operational work and/or improvement activities, they will not feel they have the support to remove waste from the existing process.
- Are they getting time, capacity and space to learn and improve
- Go over improvement they have found at a team level

## Collection of Data

- It is intended to reduce burden on the team
- One trap is to be too prescriptive about the definitions of the work
  - Let the team define it themselves
- Understand the current condition
- Set new target
- Continuous improvement

## Leader's Role

- Be supportive
- Resolve team needs that surface

## Implement Feedback Loops

- Especially for "unhealthy" products
  - A lot of errors
  - Poor performance
  - Crash rate
- Feedback loop allow for prioritization of operational work
  - vs having a separate operational team that focus on service restoration

## Redefining "Features"

- Resilience
- Performance
- Health of the product

## Making Data Visible

- Let stakeholders see operational challenges

## Consider eNPS

- Seek to understand low eNPS score
- Investigate to learn from a high eNPS
- High performing teams are more likely to recommend their workplace and team
- Employee engagement drives business outcome
- Another version of a feedback loop
