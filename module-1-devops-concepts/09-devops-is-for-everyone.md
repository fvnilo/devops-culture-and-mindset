# DevOps Works for Everyone: Three Case Studies

There is an assumption that DevOps only work if:

- you are building from scratch
- or are leveraging the principles in a small startup

In reality, it works regardless of the methodology.

## Nordstrom

- Transitioning from agile methodology to lean value stream mapping
- Chose two pilot teams practicing two different methodologies
- Value Stream Mapping Workshop:
  - Collaboration made the difference
  - Operated as one team
  - Made improvements to their working environment
- Results:
  - Before workshop: multiple incidents per week
  - After workshop: zero incidents in a month
  - Done through automation and removing waste from existing process
  - Tripled the number of business requests
- Outcomes:
  - More revenue and saved money
  - Team was optimized and gained efficiency

## Nordstrom: Mainframe Application

- Instead of a replatform, proposition of a value stream mapping workshop
  - Brought anyone working on that application, including business users
  - Documented what it took to complete a cosmetics rebate
- Found out that front-end process was the problem
  - Cosmetics business managers who are on the sales floor did not have information
    - It needed to go off the floor in order to do the research and submit the request
  - Often the request was kicked back because of missing information
  - This creates a hand-off loop
- Solution: create an iPad app
  - Ability to submit information on the floor
  - All that was needed were improvements to the process
- Outcome:
  - Went from a month-long process to days and even hours

## Starbucks

- POS System
- Assumptions were made that improvements could not be done
  - Legacy software package
- A value stream mapping workshop was done on what it took for a new feature to be delivered to POS
- Solution:
  - Automated test scripts for code
  - Broke work down into smaller batches
- Went from 88 Days Lead Time To 11
