# DevOps Principles: The Seven Principles and Seven Wastes of Lean

## Translating Lean's 7 Principles into Software Development

### Principle #1: Eliminate Waste

- Do not code more feature than needed
- Minimizing handoffs
- Not producing anything of low or no value

### Principle #2: Build Quality In

"Quality is everyone's responsibility" - Dr. William Edwards Deming

Varify that quality is built into the product and processes.

### Principle #3: Create Knowledge

- Amplifying learning
  - Learn from feedback loops
  - Learn from issues
- Development is constant learning

### Principle #4: Defer Commitment

- Make decisions at the right time after analysis and consideration
- Delay decisions until you have more information

There are **2 types of decision making**

- One-way door: can't come back
  - Information gathering is critical
- Two-way door: can come back

Decision-making depends on distinction

### Principle #5: Deliver Fast

- Ensure feedback is received early and often
- Allow for course correction
- Smaller batches allow to deliver fast

### Principle #6: Respect People

Lack of respect for people in the culture will tear down Lean and DevOps.

### Principle #7: Optimize the Whole

System thinking. Do not focus on local optimization.

## Translating Lean's 7 Wastes into Software Development

### Waste #1: Partially Done Work

Examples:
  - Completed code not checked into repository
  - Undocumented code
  - Untested Code

It delays delivery of value and leads to quality issue.

### Waste #2: Extra Features

Do not build more than the customer needs. No one will use them.

### Waste #3: Revisiting Decisions

Resurfacing decisions or informations is wasteful.

### Waste #4: Handoffs

Each handoff requires a team to orient themselves with the work of the previous team(s). Includes back and forth communication. It creates delays. 

### Waste #5: Delays

Whenever process has to wait to proceed.

Examples:

- Code compilation time
- Reviews for another silo

### Waste #6: Task Switching

Research proves "multitasking" is the enemy of all productivity. Avoid context switching.

### Waste #7: Defects

Build quality in from the get-go.
