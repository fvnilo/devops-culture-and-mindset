# The Three Ways

When encountering skeptics: Read Dr. William Edwards Deming about Systems Thinking

Quotes:

"Quality is everyone's responsibility"
"Learning is not compulsory. Neither is survival"

## Systems Thinking

Emphasis on the performance of the entire system as opposed to the performance of a specific silo. Promote collaboration accross functional lines. Focus on IT-enabled value streams.

**Outcomes**:

- Stop passing defects downstreams
- Not allowing local optimization
- Always seek to increase flow
- Profound understanding of the system

**Examples of practical actions**:

- Documenting value stream to see defects sent downstream
- Discover sub-optimization
- Investments in automated testing and quality measurement

## Amplifying Feedback Loop

A feedback loop is a process that allows for reflection on its own output before determining the next steps that need to be completed.

**Outcomes**:

- Understanding and responding to all customers
- Shortening and amplifying all feedback loops
- Embedding knowledge where needed

**Examples of practical actions**:

- Build automated tests into pipeline
  - Development will have feedback early
- Embed operations engineers into dev team
- Quality dashboards (e.g. percentage of test failed)

## A Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning

- Create that culture
- Encourage risk-taking and failing forward
- Affirm that repetition in practice is a prerequisite to mastery

**Outcome**:

- Allocating time for improvement work
- Reward teams for taking risks
- Introduce faults into the system to increase resilience

**Examples of practical actions**:

- Required strategic alignment
- Culture of innovation
- Innovation Days
- Hackathons
- Capacity provided for learning
- Canary users

The biggest challenges:

- Figure out how to protect capacity
- Pressure on delivery over experimentation and learning

Consider chaos engineering:

- Chaos Monkey
- Resilience Engineering to prepare for outages
- Create a culture where it is safe to take risk
