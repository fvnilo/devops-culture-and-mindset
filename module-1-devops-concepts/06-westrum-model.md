# The Westrum Model for Improving Organizational Culture

Devops is all about culture. If culture is not supportive, organizations will not be high-performing.

## Origins

- Ron Westrum researched human factors in system safety. 
  - Particularly, in the context of accidents and technological domains that are highly complex and risky such as aviation and healthcare.
- This led to development of topology of organizational cultures in 1988

## Topology

- **Pathological** (or Power-oriented): Large amounts of fear and threat. People often hoard information or withhold it for political reasons or distort it to make themselves look better.
- **Bureaucratic** (or Rule-oriented): Departments want to maintain their turf, insist on their own rules and generally do things by the book, their book.
- **Generative** (or Performance-oriented): Focus on the mission. Everything is subordinated to good performance and doing what we are supposed to do.

|Pathological|Bureaucratic|Generative|
|-|-|-|
|Power-oriented|Rule-oriented|Performance-oriented|
|Low co-operation|Modest co-operation|High co-operation|
|Messengers shot|Messengers neglected|Messengers trained|
|Responsibilities shirked|Narrow responsibilities|Risk are shared|
|Bridging discouraged|Bridging tolerated|Bridging encouraged|
|Failures leads to scapegoating|Failure leads to justice|Failure leads to inquiry|
|Novelty crushed|Novelty leads to problems|Novelty implemented|

- Co-operation: DevOps is all about collaboration and co-operation. Teams collaborate in a generative culture.
- Messengers: In a generative culture, it is encouraged to bring information forward and discuss it in a meaningful way.
- Responsibilities: In a DevOps culture, we want high collaboration and sharing.
- Bridging: Breaking down barriers. 
- Failure: In a generative culture, failure is an opportunity to learn.
- Novelty: In a generative culture, we want to get better.

Organizational Culture Predicts Information Flow
Culture can predict software delivery performance

3 characteristics of good information:

- Answers are provided
- Timely
- Presented in such a way that it can effectively be used

Culture enables information processing through three mechanisms:

Characteristics of a generative culture

1. Effective collaboration and higher level of trust accross the organization and up and down the hierarchy.
2. Emphasis on the mission which allows people to put aside their personal issues and also the departemental issues that are evident in bureaucratic organization.
3. Hierarchy plays less of a role. 

Also:
- Better information is available to make decisions
- Team is open and transparent
- Culture predicts performance
  - Problems are more rapidly discovered and adressed

A good culture requires trust and cooperation across the organization. It indicates high-quality decision making.
