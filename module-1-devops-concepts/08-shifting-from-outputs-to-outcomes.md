# Changing Metrics: Shifting From Outputs to Outcomes

## Outputs vs Outcomes

- Output: What we deliver
  - New key feature
  - Number of bugs resolved
  - Number of tickets closed successfully
- Outcome: What we gain from output
  - Revenue generated from the new key feature
  - Customer retention

Focus should be on outcome.

In most cases, there are only 2 outcomes that a business is trying to achieve

1. **Increasing revenue**
2. Reducing cost by **improving efficiency**

## Metrics To Measure Outcomes

### Deployment Pain

- Measures difficulty of code deployment to production
- It indicates how high-performing an organization is
- It can also indicate employee burnout and culture

**Example**:

- Deployment takes a war room of about 30-50 people, staffed 24/7 for 72 hours
  - Not sustainable
- Team focus on strategies to alleviate production deployment
  - Get the deployment window down
- Focused on automation and breaking releases to smaller batches

### Change Failure Rate

- Change sent to production failed
- High-performing organizations have low-failure rate = 0%-15%
- Focus on deploying smaller changes more frequently
- Make rollback easy to do
  - Even better if the rollback is automatic
- Leverage feature flags

### Deployment Frequency

- High-performing organizations deploy on-demain and multiple times per day
- Directly correlated with deployment pain

**Example**:

- Migrating to the cloud a low-risk component
  - Validation and learning before going big
  - Test, learn and respond to market needs
- Use blue/green deployments to learn and mitigate risks

### Lead Time

- How long it takes from identifying the need for a change to having that change fully integrated and in the customers' hands
- High-performing organization might have a lead time of an hour or less

### Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

- How long it takes to identify an issue, fix the problem and restore service (average)
- High performing MTTR: less than an hour

### Unplanned Work

- Key indicator of organizational performance
- Frequency of disruption
  - Keeps from delivering project on time
- It is important to see how much is going on in an organization

### Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)

- "How likely you would be to refer someone to your team"
- "How likely would you be to refer someone to the overall organization"
- Culture is very important within a team and organization

Outcome based teams have the highest eNPS while output based teams have a low eNPS.
