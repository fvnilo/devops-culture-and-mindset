# Leadership Philosophies

## Honor and Extract Reality

- Accept reality and focus on the path forward
- If a team encounters complexity and they communicate it to leadership, the way the leader responds is extremely impactful to the culture
- Shooting the messenger is a leader responding negatively
- Build trust with the team to make them feel save
- Use "how" instead of "who". (e.g. "How can I help?")
  - Who can evoke the feeling of blame

## Understand the Work

- Concept of gemba: Japanese term meaning "the actual place"
- Leaders need to go to the teams. It is not micromanagement if it is **go to see** rather than **go and tell**

## Root Cause Philosophies

- Human error is not a root cause
  - Creates a generative culture
  - Talk about what broke down in the system
- No single root cause
  - We are working on complex system
- Ask: "How could we learn from this?"

## Workind With Complex Systems

- Multiple contributing factors
- Focus on learning vs. finding root cause
- Encourage a learning environment
- Saying "I want to make sure this will never happen again" does not encourage learning and does not create the right environment.

- New experiences give additional knowledge and build resilience

## Organization's #1 Asset: People

- Lean is all about **RESPECT** for people
- Create high trust and generative culture
