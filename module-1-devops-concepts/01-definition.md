# Definition Of DevOps

DevOps' roots lie in lean management

- Deliver more value with less waste
- Strong focus on respect for people

Lean values in DevOps

- Break down historic silos
- Improve **collaboration** between Development and Operations
- Streamline and improve work in key ways
- Cultural focus: **Deliver values to customer**

**CAMS**: Culture Automation Measurement Sharing
**CALMS**: Culture Automation Lean Measurement Sharing

Definitions:

- "DevOps is about humans. DevOps is a set of practices and patterns that turn human capital into high-performance organizational capital" -John Willis
- DevOps is the emerging professional movement that advocates a collaborative working relationship between Development and IT Operations, resulting in the fast flow of planned work (i.e., high deploy rates), while simultaneously increasing the reliability, stability, resilience, and security of the production environment.” – Gene Kim

A full lifecycle of value delivery comprises of **Building**, **Deployment**, **Operating** and **Supporting**. This means that the whole organization needs a cultural change. (Development, Test, Release Managers, Operations. Everybody is accountable.)

_Note_: DevSecOps includes security in the lifecycle.

Should an organization create a "DevOps team"? It's about the culture rather than a team of saviors. It's about building practices around CALMS.
