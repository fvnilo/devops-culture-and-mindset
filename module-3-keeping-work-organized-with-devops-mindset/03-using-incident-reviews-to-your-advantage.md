# Using Incident Reviews to Your Advantage

## Incident Reviews Used To Be A Blame Game

- Software engineers in the hot seat
- Interrogation for root cause of incident
- Action plan so it "never happens again"
- Tasks not followed up or completed

Results:

- Everybody is fustrated
- People were apprehensive when an incident review was scheduled

## Blameless Incident Reviews

- Shift in the industry
- Encourage candor and learning
- No shame or guilt about what happened
  - Instead perform critical and objective analysis
- Plan prevention strategies for the future

## Honoring and Extracting Reality

- Seek to discover what really happened
- It has to be **safe** for reality to surface
- If leaders don't want to understand, they will not be able to extract reality

## Is the Culture Pathological or Generative

- Pathological Culture: Failure => Blame and Scapegoating
- Generative Culture: Failure => Inquiry, Learning, Blame-free
  - Teams will engage in another way

## Planning Blameless Incident Reviews

- Calls for a good facilitator
- Encourages open exploration
- There is an [Etsy Facilitator Guide](https://github.com/etsy/DebriefingFacilitationGuide/tree/master/guide)

## Study Successes

You can learn as much from a successful change than a failed one.

- What worked?
- What can we learn from success?
- What can we apply to other parts of the organization?

## Transformation of Root Cause Analysis

- Then: we sought a single root cause
  - Five why's
- Now: The thinking has changed. With complex systems we must seek multiple contributing factors

## Myth: Human Errors as the Root Cause

- Human errors are never the root cause
- Something in the system broke down
  - Usually it is a process failure
    - e.g. an engineer is overworked, which is still a process failure
      - Too much WIP?
      - Management failure?
      - Capacity Planning?

## Benefits

- Focus shifted from blame to improvement
- Able to identify better leading indicators
- Multiple contributing factor managed
