# Work is Work

- Put Dev and Ops in one backlog of "work"
- Organized teams to do the "work"
- The goal is to help everyone to see all types of work needed to build and maintain the product
- Work is easier to track

Expected outcomes:

- Solve lack of collaboration
- Clarify the vague sense of what other are working on
- Put Dev and Ops together as "work"

## It Takes Time and Planning

- Test with a few teams first
  - Then scale
- Teams need practice to get result
- Find a Way to Quantify Operational Work

## Prioritizing is Important

- Teams know the impact of not prioritizing
- PM must align with value assessment and prioritization of the work
- Track ratio of work done in each category

## Start Implementing "Work is Work" Concept

1. Create **consolidated backlog** of "work"
2. Set up a prioritization mechanism
3. Set up a way to measure progress

### Demonstrate a Change is Needed

- Use data that informs of a product health
  - Incidents
  - Quality metrics
  - MTTR
  - MTTD (Mean time to detect)
- Use product specifics metrics
  - App crash rates
  - Error rates
  - API response times

### Align Teams on Target State

- _Example_: Shared target of reducing MTTR by 20%
- Shift teams conversation to work is work
